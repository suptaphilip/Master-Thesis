### Abstract
Mobile Human-Computer Interaction is the relationship (interaction) between people and their handheld mobile systems and the applications which we use in our everyday life. In a word, mobile applications are interactive products to support users in their day to day life no matter where they are.
Since technology is moving fast and changing rapidly, it is very important to understand the mobile interaction techniques and the impact of possible mobile technologies on human life. Mobile HCI concerns about the mobile applications and PDA which discusses the different possible interaction techniques with those applications. In the university cafeteria provides services manually to the students which cause different kinds of problems such as losing time in cafeteria queue, unable to browse and choose meal in advance, does not provides any kind of dieting advises to students which help them to keep proper dieting. In this thesis, I have proposed an adaptive, interactive mobile application which is called “Smart Cafeteria” that will provide services to the university students and faculties for managing their meal in the universities’ cafeterias which in consequence makes their life more easy and comfortable. In this work from beginning to end, I have followed HCI interaction design methodology in every step such as problem define, data gathering, requirement analysis, prototype development and usability evaluation for “Smart Cafeteria” application.

### Smart Cafeteria Template

The template prototype was designed using html5, css3, twitter bootstrap, jQuery which gives  Responsive design prototype. I have used Eclipse IDE with Apache server to run the application prototype. Finally using phonegap I have built android apps prototype to evaluate prototype using user study.

### Smart Cafeteria Report

The final Report of Smart Cafeteria has been compiled using Miktex and Eclipse TeXlipse plugins. The report contains all my work from beginning to end.
